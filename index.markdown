I use quantitative methods to study the interplay between human behavior and infectious diseases: how human activity can impact epidemic dynamics and how people respond to outbreaks. I also work to improve personal and collective responses to infectious diseases by [communicating](https://mjharris95.github.io/media) my science and counteracting health misinformation. As the President of [Scientists Speak Up](https://scientistsspeakup.org/), I organized seminars and workshops on communication and advocacy around scientific topics like vaccination and climate change.

I am a postdoc with [Joshua Weitz](https://weitzgroup.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland (Department of Biology and Institute for Health Computing). I received my PhD in Biology at Stanford University where I was advised by [Erin Mordecai](https://www.mordecailab.com/). During winter quarter of 2023, I was a visiting student at the [Center for an Informed Public](https://www.cip.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington studying vaccine misinformation with [Jevin West](https://jevinwest.org/). I earned dual bachelor's degrees in Applied Mathematics and Computational Biology from the University of Georgia, where I conducted undergraduate research with [John Drake](https://daphnia.ecology.uga.edu/drakelab/).
